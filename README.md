Source codes of the projects for ECE-453 Advanced Computer Architecture at Cooper Union
 ## ECE-453:
 This course studies modern, advancedtechniques used to design and producecurrent, state-of-the-art computerarchitectures. Technology, performanceand price. The quantitative principleand Amdahl's law. Instruction sets;addressing modes, operands andopcodes; encoding instruction sets.RISC versus CISC architectures; MIPS.Pipelining; the classic five-stagepipeline, hazards, exceptions, floatingpoint operations. Advanced pipeliningtechniques: dynamic scheduling,branch prediction. Multiple issue,speculation. Limits of parallelism.Compiler support for parallelism, VLIW.Caches. Examination of modernprocessors.
